# My Personal Project: MoodI

## Journal and mood tracking application

**What will the application do?**
MoodI will allow you to express and record your daily feelings and emotions. It combines the functionality of both
a journal and a mood tracker, as each journal entry must be tagged with an associated emotion of the day. You can 
revisit past entries and reflect on your growth, as well as view a colour-coded chart of your different moods over
a period of time.

**Who will use it?**
MoodI is for anyone who is looking to improve their emotional well-being and mental health by reflecting on their 
thoughts and feelings. The mood tracker aspect also allows people to observe their mood changes over time through
simple data visualizations.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
I've experienced how beneficial self-reflection is, and writing down one's daily feelings and thoughts can aid that
process of observing your growth and mental well-being. However, writing long-winded journal entries has
never been my thing, and therefore I have a hard time keeping up with this habit. So, I added MoodI's mood 
tracking feature to allow for people like me to simply select an emotion for each day, and still have a visual 
representation of their emotional well-being at the end of the month to look back and reflect on.
